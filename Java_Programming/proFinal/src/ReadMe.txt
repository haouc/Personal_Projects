Thank you for reviewing my final project.
There are several points that could ne helpful if I note here, I think. They are about the operation of the game.

OPERATION:
Space: fire weapon
Arrows:
    up, move forward;
    down, move backward;
    left, rotate counter-clockwise;
    right, rotate clockwise.

A: shield
F: non-guided missile
S: start game
Q: quit game
P: game pause

1, There will be a about 10-15 seconds interval between appearance of foes and the start. The player can take advantage
to get used to the operation of this falcon.

2, The falcon has a forward flame (Blue) to push forward and backward flame (Yellow) to pull back.

3, The shield has a relatively long duration of time once it is activated by pressing 'A'. But you can either cancel the
shield by pressing 'A' again or wait.

4, For same reason, I make the shield can not be on when the falcon fires. I believe that could be helping to balance the
game and player can not fight without any threats from foes because the falcon can fire with a long duration shield. If this
setting cause any inconvenience, I am sorry.

5, Just for in case that the player overly rely on the shield and overlook the time, I also set a color switch and siren
when the shield is close to be off to remind player..

6, The background pictures are switched when the level gets promoted. The level is decided by the scores players get in playing.

7, Two floaters are presenting in the game for a certain time intervals. One of them (Blue Star-like) are giving one more
falcon if the player get it; the other (Red Bomb-like) gives super bomb and destroy all foes on the screen at that moment.
